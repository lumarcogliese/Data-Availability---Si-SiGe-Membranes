This repository contains the data and analysis scripts supporting the findings in the pre-print Fabrication, characterization and mechanical loading of Si/SiGe membranes for spin qubit devices by L. Marcogliese et al. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14589)

The figures (X = [1,6]) can be firectly reproduced with the Jupyter Notebooks FigX.
Raw data (ellipsometry, AFM, profilometry, microscopy) and simulation results (finite element and Kirchoff-Love plate theory) can be found under "Raw_data" and "Simulation_data".

Fits to ellipsometric data can be reproduced with ellipsometry_tmm_model.ipynb which relies on the complex refractive indices in the "Material_parameters" directory.
